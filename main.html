                    The game’s mechanics are quite simple: you need to take down the enemy Crystal, which is located at the core of the enemy’s base. 
                    To reach this, your team will have to kill enemy outer turrets (the turrets closest to the middle of the map), 
                    inner turrets (the second turrets you encounter, closer to the base), and finally, base turrets (the turrets located in the base, right before the Crystal) to open the base.

                    You’re just at the start, but you want to have a good one. So, you should start by learning the skills of the heroes you own and try to practice playing them in their assigned roles. 
                    You should then save some currency to unlock some of the meta heroes, which are strong in the current patch/season. 
                    You should take a look at our tier list to learn who they are.

            <h2 class="faq-question" itemprop="name">Mobile Legends: How do I get Diamonds and Battle Points(BP)</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                <div itemprop="text">
                    You can only get Diamonds by purchasing them. As far as I know, there are no ways of getting free Diamonds at the moment.<br>
                    <br>
                    Battle Points can be obtained in a number of ways, from daily login to in-game events and much more. 
                    You can use BP to purchase Heroes, similar to how you would use Diamonds. 
                    For f2p players, this should be more than enough to give you the ability to start off in the game and acquire the heroes you want.

            <h2 class="faq-question" itemprop="name">How do I unlock free Mobile Legends skins?</h2>
            <div class="faq-answer" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                <div itemprop="text">
                    One of the best parts of Mobile Legends in my opinion is the free skins galore. 
                    The moment you install the game, you’ll receive an abundance of free limited-time/limited-use skins, which you can take complete advantage of at any point.
                    Most of the chests, newbie rewards, and events will also reward players with free temporary skins.
